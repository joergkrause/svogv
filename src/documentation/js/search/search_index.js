An object with several properties, decorated with UI instructions, created a whole form.\nExample\nThe simplest form of usage looks like this:\n \n    \n      Edit current user\n      You must have a form and provide the groups name. Internally, the ReactiveFormsModule is being used. The logic expects several decorators, that are being examined and based on the findings a FormGroup object is being created. That's handled by a service the SvogvModule provides. The component's code looks like this:\nimport { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';\nimport { FormGroup } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { FormValidatorService } from 'svogv';\nimport { UserViewModel } from '../../../viewmodels';\n\n@Component({\n  templateUrl: './editorautoform.component.html'\n})\nexport class EditorAutoformComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\n\n  userForm: FormGroup;\n  user: UserViewModel;\n\n  constructor(private formService: FormValidatorService) {\n  }\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    this.userForm = this.formService.build(UserViewModel);\n  }\n\n}The first magic is the call of the build method. The second magic is the usage of decorators. A typical view model (in the example UserViewModel) would look like this:\nexport class UserViewModel {\n\n  @Hidden()\n  id: number = 0;\n\n  @Display('E-Mail', 20, 'E-Mail address')\n  @Required()\n  @MaxLength(100)\n  @Email()\n  email: string = '';\n\n  @Display('Phone Number', 30, 'The user\\'s phone')\n  @Required()\n  @MaxLength(20)\n  phoneNumber: string = '';\n\n  @Display('User Name', 33, 'The full name')\n  @Required('User Name is required')\n  @MaxLength(100)\n  userName: string = '';\n\n  @Display('Age', 40, 'From 12 to 88')\n  @DisplayGroup('Personal')\n  @Range(12, 88)\n  age: number = 24;\n\n  @Display('Birthday', 50)\n  @DisplayGroup('Personal')\n  birthday: Date = new Date();\n\n  @Display('Is Active', 60)\n  active: boolean = true;\n\n  @Display('Password', 70)\n  @DisplayGroup('Password')\n  @Required()\n  @Compare('passWordTwo')\n  passWord: string = '';\n\n  @Display('Password', 80)\n  @DisplayGroup('Password')\n  @Required()\n  passWordTwo: string = '';\n\n  @Display('Done', 100, 'Work progress')\n  done?: number = 0;\n\n}Note, that the default values for initialization are mandatory. The decorators comes in two flavors:\n\nUI decorators control the appearance (such as @Display)\nValidators control the validation\n\nSVOGV is using the ReactiveFormsModule and handles everything in a straight Angular way.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { Component, Input, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { FormGroup } from '@angular/forms';\n\n/**\n * This component creates a complete editor from a viewmodel. The viewmodel should have\n * decorators to control the form's behavior. The form can be styled an supports validation.\n * It creates one field for each property not decorated with {@link Hidden}decorator.\n *\n * Example of usage:\n * /#/editor\n */\n@Component({\n  selector: 'ac-autoform',\n  styles: [\n    'fieldset { border-top: 1px silver solid; padding: 10px; }',\n    'legend { width: auto; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; font-size: 1em;}'\n  ],\n  templateUrl: './autoform.component.html'\n})\nexport class AutoFormComponent implements OnInit {\n  /**\n   * A reference to the form.

of the Editoromponent\nA form can make use of the EditorComponent, named . An object with several properties, decorated with UI instructions, created a whole form.\nExample\nThe simplest form of usage looks like this:\n\n  \n    Edit current user\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n       Save\n       Save &amp; Close\n      \n         Cancel &amp; Return to List\n      \n    \n  \nThe styling is baded on Bootstrap 4.\nYou must have a form and provide the groups name. Internally, the ReactiveFormsModule is being used. The logic expects several decorators, that are being examined and based on the findings a FormGroup object is being created. That's handled by a service the SvogvModule provides. The component's code looks like this:\nimport { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';\nimport { FormGroup, NgForm } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { FormValidatorService } from 'svogv';\nimport { UserViewModel } from '../../../viewmodels';\n\n@Component({\n  templateUrl: './editorform.component.html'\n})\nexport class EditorFormComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\n\n  userForm: NgForm;\n  userFormGroup: FormGroup;\n  user: UserViewModel;\n\n  constructor(private formService: FormValidatorService) {\n  }\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    this.userFormGroup = this.formService.build(UserViewModel);\n  }\n\n}\nThe first magic is the call of the build method. The second magic is the usage of decorators. A typical view model (in the example UserViewModel) would look like this:\nexport class UserViewModel {\n\n  @Hidden()\n  id: number = 0;\n\n  @Display('E-Mail', 20, 'E-Mail address')\n  @Required()\n  @MaxLength(100)\n  @Email()\n  email: string = '';\n\n  @Display('Phone Number', 30, 'The user\\'s phone')\n  @Required()\n  @MaxLength(20)\n  phoneNumber: string = '';\n\n  @Display('User Name', 33, 'The full name')\n  @Required('User Name is required')\n  @MaxLength(100)\n  userName: string = '';\n\n  @Display('Age', 40, 'From 12 to 88')\n  @DisplayGroup('Personal')\n  @Range(12, 88)\n  age: number = 24;\n\n  @Display('Birthday', 50)\n  @DisplayGroup('Personal')\n  birthday: Date = new Date();\n\n  @Display('Is Active', 60)\n  active: boolean = true;\n\n  @Display('Password', 70)\n  @DisplayGroup('Password')\n  @Required()\n  @Compare('passWordTwo')\n  passWord: string = '';\n\n  @Display('Password', 80)\n  @DisplayGroup('Password')\n  @Required()\n  passWordTwo: string = '';\n\n  @Display('Done', 100, 'Work progress')\n  done?: number = 0;\n\n}Note, that the default values for initialization are mandatory. The decorators comes in two flavors:\n\nUI decorators control the appearance (such as @Display)\nValidators control the validation\n\nSVOGV is using the ReactiveFormsModule and handles everything in a straight Angular way.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { Component, Input, Output, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { FormGroup } from '@angular/forms';\n\n/**\n * The Editor Widget.

includes these components:\n\nHidden: Element will not be rendered as column in ac-datagrid\nDisplay: Change columns header or label name and add a tooltip optionally\n\nAlso several validation decorators are supported:\n\nRequired: Property must have a value\nMaxLength: Max number of chars (string only)\nMinLength: Min number of chars (string only)\nPattern: A regular expression\nRange: A range of type number or of type Date for the property's value\nEmail: Check whether the property contains a valid email\n\nAs the alpha process continues, these components will continue to evolve. There will be\nbreaking changes between alpha releases; the alpha releases are here for people that want an\nearly look or who like to live on the edge and are very tolerant of breaking API and behavior\nchanges.\n\n0.0.23 (2017-01-20)\nA pre-production release of SVOGV!\nThis is the first we use in production to see how to use basic functions in real world environment.\n\nPlaceholder: A new decorator to put watermarks into editor elements\n\nNew validation decorators:\n\nCompare: Compare two fields, such as in password field combinations\n\nSeveral widgets are now usable:\n\nDataGrid\nEditors\nInfoBox\nMenu, which comes in two flavors:\nDropMenu -- a complex multi level menu\nSideMenu -- a simple one level menu\n\n\nTreeView\nBreadCrumb\nTabs\n\nStill under construction, because of SMIL we use for SVG and that we still need to get rid of:\n\nAnalogClock\nLoaderIcon\n\nThe demo does now use WebPack 2 to create the bundles. SystemJS loader is still working for debugging.\n\n0.2.1 (2017-09-14)\nSVOGV in usable state\nThe base library with the decorators and controls is usable. The HUD part is still very experimental. I'm going to remove this part shortly and create another project out of it. It will make the lib smaller and more reliable.\nThese to elements are now working and good for production:\n\nAnalogClock\nLoaderIcon\n\nThere are many fixes in both, demo and lib.\n\n0.2.3 (2017-09-15)\nA release mostly dedicated to fixes and reorg. Some components sued just to run the demo were actually in the main lib and hence I have removed them and put in the demo. So the code is still there, but nit as part of the main lib. This makes the lib a lot smaller and it clarifies the intention not competing with the other UI libs but put the focus on forms and validation.\n\n0.3.5 (2018-01-15)\nA redesign, mainly removing all experimental parts.\n\n0.6.0 (2018-09-15)\nAn update to support Angular 5 and 6. This is also a change in naming the versions. 0.6.* is for Angular 6, 0.7.* will be the one for Angular 7 and so on.\nAlso, this is a big change from Gulp/Rollup based build process to using the Angular CLI. After a ton of experiments with WebPack 4 and almost very loader the outcome was more or less fruststrating. With Angular CLI, I must admit, the results are perfect, stable and small packages, and an easy setup procedure.\n\n0.7.0 (2019-01-31)\nAgain a big redesign. Mostly renaming and reorg. It's a need for the way to 1.0. It follows more strictly the Angular guide line for code.\nAlso, it's now made for Angular 7 and TypeScript 3.\n\n0.7.1 (2019-04-24)\nSome fixes and some function are now working properly that didn't made it into 7.0.0.\n\nTreeView event behavior\nDatagrid Pagination styles\nDatagrid Templates\nDatagrid Pipe support\n\n\n0.7.2 (2019-04-30)\nRenamed property userForm to formGroup for editor component. Equals the autoform now and is less irritating. Unfortunately, this is a breaking change.\n\n0.7.3 (2019-05-02)\nAdded the decorator Sortable to suppress sorting (default is on for all columns) or provide a custom sort function. Made the sorting available for the whole header element (additionally to the sort buttons) and hence it's now toggling. This is a more intuitive behavior. The button currently showing the sort direction by being in disabled state.\nAdded the decorator UiHint to add custom styles to grid's header or, in case of an editor element, to the input element.\nRemoved some not used classes to save code space.\n\n0.8.0 (2019-08-13)\nUpdate references and dependencies to reflect Angular 8.\n\n0.9.0 (2020-03-31)\nUpdate references and dependencies to reflect Angular 9. Several bug fixes and refinements for the grid.\nClean up code, improve documentation and follow current linter rules.\nThis is the last release before we convert to new project structure in the @svogv realm. Stay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"contributing.html":{"url":"contributing.html","title":"getting-started - contributing","body":"\n                   \n\nContributing to SVOGV\nWe would love for you to contribute to SVOGV and help make it ever better!\nAs a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:\n\nCode of Conduct\nQuestion or Problem?\nIssues and Bugs\nFeature Requests\nSubmission Guidelines\nCoding Rules\nCommit Message Guidelines\nSigning the CLA\n\nIn case of any questions please contact me at !\n Code of Conduct\nHelp us keep Angular open and inclusive. Please read and follow our Code of Conduct.\n Got a Question or Problem?\nIf you have questions about how to use SVOGV, please direct them to the \nGoogle Group discussion list or StackOverflow. \nPlease note that SVOGV is still in very early development, and the team's capacity \nto answer usage questions is limited. Community chat is also available on Gitter.\n Found an Issue?\nIf you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by\nsubmitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Including an issue \nreproduction (via CodePen, JsBin, Plunkr, etc.) is the absolute best way to help the team quickly\ndiagnose the problem. Screenshots are also helpful.\nYou can help the team even more and submit a Pull Request with a fix.\n Want a Feature?\nYou can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub\nRepository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with\na proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it. SVOGV is in very early \nstages and we are not ready to accept major contributions ahead of the full release.\nPlease consider what kind of change it is:\n\nFor a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be\ndiscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,\nand help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.\nSmall Features can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.\n\n Submitting an Issue\nBefore you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.\nIf your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.\nHelp us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new\nfeatures by not reporting duplicate issues.  Providing the following information will increase the\nchances of your issue being dealt with quickly:\n\nOverview of the Issue - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps\nAngular and Bootstrap Versions - which versions of Angular and Bootstrap are affected\n  (e.g. 2.2.0)\nMotivation for or Use Case - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior\n  is a bug for you\nBrowsers and Operating System - is this a problem with all browsers?\nReproduce the Error - provide a live example (using CodePen, JsBin,\n  Plunker, etc.) or a unambiguous set of steps\nScreenshots - Due to the visual nature of the SVOGV widgets, screenshots can help the team\n  triage issues far more quickly than a text descrption.\nRelated Issues - has a similar issue been reported before?\nSuggest a Fix - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be\n  causing the problem (line of code or commit)\n\nYou can file new issues by providing the above information here.\n Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\nSearch GitHub for an open or closed PR\nthat relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\n\nPlease sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before sending PRs.\nWe cannot accept code without this.\n\nMake your changes in a new git branch:\n   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master\nCreate your patch, including appropriate test cases.\n\nFollow our Coding Rules.\n\nTest your changes with our supported browsers and screen readers.\n\nRun the full SVOGV test suite, as described in the developer documentation,\nand ensure that all tests pass.\n\nCommit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our\ncommit message conventions. Adherence to these conventions\nis necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.\n   git commit -aNote: the optional commit -a command line option will automatically \"add\" and \"rm\" edited files.\n\nPush your branch to GitHub:\n  git push my-fork my-fix-branch\nIn GitHub, send a pull request to svogv:master.\n\nIf we suggest changes then:\n\nMake the required updates.\n\nRe-run the SVOGV test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\n\nRebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull\nRequest):\ngit rebase master -i\ngit push -f\n\n\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\nAfter your pull request is merged\nAfter your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes\nfrom the main (upstream) repository:\n\nDelete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as\n  follows:\n  git push my-fork --delete my-fix-branch\nCheck out the master branch:\n  git checkout master -f\nDelete the local branch:\n  git branch -D my-fix-branch\nUpdate your master with the latest upstream version:\n  git pull --ff upstream master\n\n Coding Rules\nTo ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:\n\nAll features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).\nAll public API methods must be documented. (Details TBD).\nWe follow Google's JavaScript Style Guide, but wrap all code at\n100 characters.\n\n Commit Message Guidelines\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to more\nreadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.  But also,\nwe use the git commit messages to generate the SVOGV change log.\nCommit Message Format\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer.  The header has a special\nformat that includes a type, a scope and a subject:\n(): \n\n\n\nThe header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.\nAny line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.\nRevert\nIf the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert:, followed by the header of\nthe reverted commit. In the body it should say: This reverts commit ., where the hash is\nthe SHA of the commit being reverted.\nType\nMust be one of the following:\n\nfeat: A new feature\nfix: A bug fix\ndocs: Documentation only changes\nstyle: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing\nsemi-colons, etc)\nrefactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\nperf: A code change that improves performance\ntest: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\nbuild: Changes that affect the build system, CI configuration or external dependencies      (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)\nchore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files\n\nScope\nThe scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example\ndatepicker, dialog, etc.\nSubject\nThe subject contains succinct description of the change:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\"\ndon't capitalize first letter\nno dot (.) at the end\n\nBody\nJust as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\".\nThe body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.\nFooter\nThe footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to\nreference GitHub issues that this commit Closes.\nBreaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines.\nThe rest of the commit message is then used for this.\nA detailed explanation can be found in this document.\n Signing the CLA\nPlease sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before sending pull requests. For any code\nchanges to be accepted, the CLA must be signed.

The current release is for Angular 8 and matches the current Angular version usually.\nThe design / UI stuff is made using Bootstrap 4, and even here the current version is used.\nIt's for developers who create standard forms and want to automate the development process.\n\nDemo and project are made using Angular CLI. Current version is made using @angular/cli.\n\nIntroduction\nThis library is for making forms. Easy and fast. It has these advantages:\n\nAll form parts are being created dynamically by using decorators. These control the UI and validation.\nAll styles are based on Bootstrap 4, can be used together with themes and custom parts can be changed.\nA grid component makes data tables very easy to use.\nA tree view is another component.\nDynamic editors and an autoform component creates the whole form without code.\n\nWhat is it?\nThe approach was simply to improve the creation of forms as simple as ever in Angular. It's an extension to Angular that comes as a set of classes (injectable services) and components.\nIt's available as source code or as ready to use umd-bundle. The bundle is plane JavaScript. The sources are available via npm and from github.\n\nIt's pretty small, too. It's 300 KB as a bundle and roughly 39 KB minified, close to 10 KB zipped.\n\nIssues?\nAs of version 0.6 none known issues. Please report issues through Github.\nHave you worked with the version 0.3 before? 0.6 has breaking changes because of a new build process.\nIn 0.7 I have again made significant changes towards the 1.0 release.\nI'm using Angular CLI for all steps and sync the version with Angular (Angular 6 is SVGOV 0.6, Angular 7 is SVGOV 0.7, and so on). After the first final is being release I plan to jump the version to match the Angular major release. Hence, 0.6 is 6, 0.7 is 7 and if I could move to 1.0 and at that time Angular 9 is out, it will become SVOGV 9.\nAngular Data Annotations\nThe idea of data annotations is somehow heavily inspired by the namespace System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations of .NET Core. There is absolutely no dependency at all, though. You can find more here.\nThe basic idea is that we usually use view models anyway. So, why not using them to provide all information necessary to create a form that way?\nHow does it work?\nLet's assume you have a viewmodel like this:\nexport class UserViewModel {\n\n  @Hidden()\n  id: Number = 0;\n\n  @Display('E-Mail', 'E-Mail address')\n  @Required()\n  @MaxLength(100)\n  @Email()\n  email: string = '';\n\n  @Display('Phone Number', 'The user\\'s phone')\n  @Required()\n  @MaxLength(20)\n  phoneNumber: string = '';\n\n  @Display('User Name', 'The full name')\n  @Required()\n  @MaxLength(100)\n  userName: string = '';\n\n}As you see there are several decorators. SVOGV has decorators for display hints, such as @Display. And it has decorators to manage the validation, such as @MaxLength().\nThe usage is simple; just import like this (selection, there are more options):\nimport {\n  Required,\n  MaxLength,\n  Range,\n  Email,\n  Display,\n  Hidden,\n  UiHint,\n  Format\n} from 'svogv';Or alternatively prefix your import:\nimport * as FormHints from 'svogv';\n\nexport class UserViewModel {\n\n  @FormHints.Display('E-Mail')\n  eMail: string = '';\n\n}Using in Forms\nThe form needs to be aware of the decorators. Hence, there is a service that creates an advanced FormGroup instance. It's called FormValidatorService. Internally it's using Angular's ReactiveFormsModule, so this is a dependency.\nIn a component's code it looks like this:\nimport { FormValidatorService } from 'svogv';\n\nexport class EditUserComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  myForm: FormGroup;\n\n  constructor(private fv: FormValidatorService) {\n  }\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    // get validators and error messages from viewmodel type\n    this.myForm = this.fv.build(UserViewModel);\n  }\n}In this example UserViewModel is the decorated view model. It's just the type that the service requires, not an actual instance. However, the service will create an instance, and hence the model must be a class, not an interface. Also, all properties must be set, usually by setting defaults, because internally the properties are read by a for of loop.\nNow the form knows all about the view model. Let's build a form on top on this:\n\n  \n    Edit current user\n      \n      \n      \n      Save\n  \nThe important part is the component . This component checks the property type, the decorators, and the form's settings and creates a complete form element in Bootstrap 4 style (the template is, of course, customizable). The connection between the service's outcome -- the FormGroup -- and the components is being made through setting the form group's instance (here myForm) using the input property formGroup.\nAnd that's it. The form is pretty, has fully working validation, and is easy to access from your component. And yes, there is no additional code necessary to get it running.\nAuto Forms\nEven simpler, you can create a complete form with just one tag. Just go like this:\n\n  \n    Edit current user\n    \n    \n      \n         Save\n      \n    \n  \nThe only component here is  that connects to the form using the attribute formGroup. Use binding syntax here as this is an object. The form is build upon Bootstrap 4 again and can be modified by several helper decorators.\nValidation Decorators\n\n\n\nDecorator\nUsage\n\n\n\n\n@StringLength\nSet the strings minimum (optional) and maximum length. It's a summary of @MinLength and @MaxLength.\n\n\n@MaxLength\nThe maximum length of a text input.\n\n\n@MinLength\nThe minimum length of a text input.\n\n\n@Pattern\nA regular expression that is used to test the text or number input.\n\n\n@Range\nA range (from-to) for either numerical values or dates.\n\n\n@Required\nMakes the field mandatory.\n\n\n@EMail\nChecks input against a (very good) regular expression to test for valid e-mail pattern.\n\n\n@Compare\nCompares with another field, usually for password comparision.\n\n\n\nUI Decorators\n\n\n\nDecorator\nUsage\n...Grid\n...Editor\n...Auto Form\n...Tree**\n\n\n\n\n@Display\nDetermine the label's name and a tooltip ( optionally), You can also provide the fields' order.\nYes, Header row\nYes, label text\nYes, label text\nNo\n\n\n@DisplayGroup\nGroups components in  elements. Can be ordered inside the form.\nNo\nNo\nYes, fieldset\nNo\n\n\n@Hidden\nExclude as field from an autoform.\nYes, excludes column\nYes, makes hidden field\nYes\nYes\n\n\n@Sortable\nMakes a column sortable. Default is true.\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n@Placeholder\nA watermark that appears in empty form fields\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\n@TemplateHint\nForces a particular render type. Usually you get fields a shown in the table below. With a hint you can force other types.\nYes, replaces cell content with template\nNo\nNo\nPlanned\n\n\n@ReadOnly\nRenders the field readonly, if the shown element can support this. For all other fields this is being ignored.\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\n@FormatPipe\nExecutes the pipe before rendering the data. Usually used in the grid component.\nYes, applies pipe to cell's content\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n@UiHint\nAdditional custom styles*.\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\n* This is available from 0.7.4 onwards. Style apply to columns' header and cells as well as to form elements in editor. The object required is a style object in the form { 'style': 'rule' }.\n** This is available from 0.7.5 onwards.\nThe editor component is able to determine the appearance dependent on the type:\n\n\n\nData Type\nTemplate Hint\nField Type\nOptions for @TemplateHint\nRemark\n\n\n\n\nstring\ntext (no params)\ntype=\"text\"\nText, TextArea\nTextArea accepts additional parameters for row and col\n\n\nboolean\nbool (no params)\ntype=\"checkbox\"\nCheckbox, Toggle, Radio\nDefault is checkbox\n\n\nnumber\nnum (no params)\ntype=\"number\"\nRange\nDefault is numeric field, Range is a slider\n\n\nDate\ndate (val,cal)*\ntype=\"date\"\nCalendar\nCalender is provided by browser feature\n\n\nenum\nenum (no params)\n-Box\n-\nRenders an Enum as Dropdown list\n\n\n\n* With cal it shows a calendar, with val just the value. Use a pipe and @FormatPipe(DatePipe) for formatting. Calendar appears in edit mode only.\nServer Support through JSON\nAs of version 0.3.5 it's possible to use a specially designed JSON object to configure the forms. It's an exact pendant to the decorators. The difference is that you don't need to write any viewmodels in TypeScript. Just deliver an appropriate formatted document from your API and you're set. Here is the definition for the JSON structure:\nexport interface FormValidatorModel {\n  [field: string]:\n      displayType |\n      displayGroupType |\n      formatType |\n      hiddenType |\n      placeHolderType |\n      compareType |\n      maxlengthType |\n      minlengthType |\n      patternType |\n      stringLengthType |\n      emailType |\n      requiredType;\n}The types have the same description as the decorators.\nThe Components\nThe components complement the editor by adding more parts typically used in forms apps. There are many such components available, but sometimes there are pieces that we need quite often but nothing is really handy. So I created a small set of such components:\n\nTreeView: An advanced tree view with icon support and many options such as selections and checkboxes. Uses EventEmitter to fire several tree node events.\nDataGrid: A classic data grid. It provides a model to handle:\npaging\nfiltering\nsorting\ndynamic columns\n\n\n\nThe grid is controlled by decorators (see table above), so the view model actually creates the grid's appearance.\nWhere to get?\nIt's available from npm by using this command:\nnpm install svogv --saveYou get these parts:\n\nFormValidatorService -- am injectable class to build reactive forms\nFormValidatorFromJsonService -- am injectable class to build reactive forms from server data\nEditor -- the universal editor component for one field\nAutoForm -- the universal editor component for complete multi field forms\nDataGrid -- an advanced grid component, model driven\nTreeView -- a tree with some nice features\nDecorators -- a set of decorators to manage the behavior and appearance of grid, tree and forms\n\nMore to read\nFor more information read the Getting started guide.\nSee demo and API docs running on SVOGV.\nDemo App\nThere is a demo app where you can see the components in action.\nSee demo and API docs running on SVOGV.\nQuick Start\nTo have a running sample in seconds do the following:\n\nClone the repository from Github\nAssure you have node running and npm and Typescript (tsc) is in the path\nExecute this command: npm install\nExecute this command: npm run build\n\nIf everything goes fine start the demo:\nnpm startA browser window shall open automatically (if not, open http://locahost:4200) and shows a dashboard from where you can navigate the various components.\nSelect these options in the left hand menu:\n\nForms Demo: All about the decorators\nWidgets > Overview: The UI widgets demo\n\n\nThe demo app is independent and has it's own package.json and node_modules folder and hence needs it's own setup. The first command (setup) takes care of this all.\n\nLicensing?\nIt's ISC licensed and it's free. I deeply believe in Open Source and will support the ecosystem by open sourcing all parts of the project. For commercial users such as enterprises I have support options.\nAbout the Author\nThe SVOGV Widget Library was written by Joerg  Krause, www.joergkrause.de, Berlin / Germany. He has many years of experience with Web-Frameworks. He were in the business in the early JavaScript days, know every single bit in jQuery and learnt a lot about Knockout, Angular, and Durandal. But time goes on. So he moved almost all projects to either AngularJS or Angular 2+. He thinks that knowing one Framework really well is more for our customers than knowing a lot just good. So he decided to do more and start contributing to the Angular ecosystem by creating awesome libraries and components.\nCan one contribute?\nYes, drop me an email with some \"about me\" stuff. Even simple feedback is appreciated.\n\nLooking for an Angular Dev?\nYes, I'm available for all kind of remote jobs. If you need a really good full-stack dev, than drop me an email (joerg@krause.de) or write through my homepage's contact form.\nI write sophisticated stuff quickly and in very high quality in these technologies:\n\nFrontend: Angular, React\nBackend: Node, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core\nCloud: Azure CosmosDb, Azure Functions, Azure Event Hub, Azure IoT, AWS S3, AWS Lambda\nOther: Alexa Skills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nISC License\nCopyright (c) [2016-2018], [Joerg  Krause]\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

It's primarily for learning purposes.\nIt's not a replacement of the common documentation for developers using the library.\nMaking Of -- How I wrote a NPM package\n\nThis is work in progress. Come back often to get recent updates. Currently it's version 0.7.3, published May 1st, 2019. The current version embraces Angular 7.x. It's working with Angular 2.x onwards.\n\nThe primary part is a almost complete introduction into the world of modern web frontend development. It encapsulates the\ntool chain, languages, repositories, cloud service and everything else you need to create awesome apps.\nThe second part is the actual development work -- the app's code and frameworks. I decided to use Angular 2 and Bootstrap 4\nas a foundation. Angular 2 introduced as familiar concept in a new way for the web: components. By building a component tree a web app gets better maintainability and clear design, that's closer to the \"treeish\" nature of HTML. It fits better in the Browser's ecosystem\nthan the traditional MVC (model view controller) model.\nA big step for web developers was the usage of TypeScript. While other pre-compilers or transpilers are around for years (CoffeeScript for instance),\nTypeScript had the most mature and professional approach. It brings web development to an enter a new level.\nHowever, this comes with a penalty. The learning curve is steep. The setup is huge and confusing. And the effort to get a simple app running\nis enormous. If you create a huge app, however, it's a trade off. Your code becomes cleaner, easier to maintain, better to read. Your development\nspeed will grow and you can be fast, really fast creating stuff. The setup effort is a one time process and hence it's usually a no-brainer.\nWhat's this about\nThis document describes the following:\n\nThe foundation of the TS/JS-ecosystem\nUsing Gulp as a build tool\nUsing Travis for CI (continues integration)\nSetup of a professional NPM package\nRules to develop a concise library\n\nThe foundation\nFirst, you need to now how to create stuff and how to deploy stuff. You need these things first:\n\nAn editor\nA command line and some tools to build and deploy your stuff\nA server to host your stuff\nA browser to view your stuff\n\nSo, that's it.\nMissing the Operating System? No problem. Choose what you like. Everything shown here will run on Linux, Windows, and even a Mac.\nSimply don't care. Welcome to the brave new world.\nNeed something to buy? No, not at all. Everything is open source and free. At least as long as you build OS stuff by yourself. For enterprises\nare some more options, such as private repositories. That's the way some companies make some money. But even so, it's really cheap. So no\nworries again.\nSome of the tools run in the cloud. I strongly recommend considering to use these tools. It saves you tons of time and money. Unless you work\nfor a secret service you don't get any benefits from doing everything locally. The amount of data you need to transfer is small. Even a bad\nconnection is usually sufficient.\nTo setup a project like this you start right now that way:\n1. Load an Editor\nI use Visual Studio Code, but you may try some others to achieve your code tasks. Some alternatives are:\n\nSublime Text\nVIM\nAtom\n\n\nA good description of all of these can be found here.\n\n2. Setup your project\nModern web development is file based. No hidden stuff, no secret folders, nothing but plain text files. Any drawback? Yes, there are many\ndifferent files needed. A lot of them, really. While writing this I made a quick count of SVOGV project, locally:\n46.822 files, 6.323 folders\nYou say: you're kidding, dude? I say: No, bro, that's the way it is. But I have good news to you. The majority is from references, dependencies\nI have to get my stuff running. Most of the libraries we use are from NPM (node package manager). That's the repository for node moduls. We take a look\ninto this shortly. The folder where all the stuff is has the name node_modules. What's in it:\n30.107 files, 4.233 folders\nSo we're pretty much down by 60%, but it's still way to many. So let's exclude more:\n\na folder /dist where my project gets published to. That generated from a script and hence I don't care (1.987 files, 170 folders).\nagain a folder named node_modules and another one called bower_components in the Demo app, counting for 13.596 files and 1.607 folders.\n\nSo what we get:\n\n\n\nPart\nFiles\nFolder\n\n\n\n\nNode Rep\n30107\n4233\n\n\nDist\n1987\n170\n\n\nDemo Reps.\n13569\n1607\n\n\n-----------\n-------\n--------\n\n\nTotal\n45690\n6010\n\n\n\nSo, finally, my own stuff is 1.132 files in 313 folders. That's still a lot, but not a much as I don't can't handle it.\nSo, start creating a folder where all the files go. Let's call it like the project: 'svogv' (you choose another name for your project, of course).\nSomewhere on my disc I type:\n$ mkdir svogv\nThe prompt I use here is $ like most *nix systems have. I remove the concrete path and you can do same on Windows as well. I recommend to choose a short start point, such as C:\\App>, too.\n\nThen go into this:\n$ cd svogvOnce you're here it's boring empty. So we need some tools to get stuff in here. The first set of tools is part of the JavaScript ecosystem:\n\nGit - host your repository and manage versions\nNode - The engine that does the hard work\n\nAnd here is how to setup node.\nNext, Git is required. Check first if it is already present on your system:\n$ git --versionIf not, install according your operating system. \nThen, an account on Github is required. Finally, the package will be hostet on Github and partially distributed to NPM. While there are alternative ways, such as Bitbucket, I recommend Github for beginners because the sheer amount of literature, support, websites, and answers on Stack Overflow\nis overwhelming. And it is, last but not least, easy enough to get the point in short time.\nSo, go to GitHub, and set up an account.\nNow, we're set and the journey into the package creation can begin. The package is about Angular 2 components and I assume that you have at least a basic\ninterest in Angular 2 stuff. So apart from talking about the package structure I'm going to explain all the component stuff as well.\nYou can continue reading here:\n\nCreate an NPM package\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/package-construction/create-an-npm-package.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/package-construction/create-an-npm-package.html","title":"additional-page - Create an NPM package","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nCreate an NPM package\nWhile we host the whole development project on Github the NPM package shall contain just that part a potential user will use.\nHence, we have to create a folder structure that supports this. A good structure would look like this:\n\\src  \n\\test\n\\dist\n\\docs\n\\guides\n\n\\node_modules\\\n\\scripts\n\\toolsThe first block is the working part, here is where you write your project's code. The second block is the supporting infrastructure and\ndepends on what you really need and want. Usually the code in here is either from an external repository (node_modules) or is being\ncreated one time and than just invokes tasks once needed.\nThe working part consists has two special folders: \\docs and \\guides. As you may know is a good documentation the foundation of your\nwhole project. Without the docs everything has less value. The documentation shall support two parts. Those who want to learn about the \nproject before making a decision to give it a try. And those who actively work with the code. In my project I have splittet the two parts\naccordingly. The reason is not necessarily the ability to split the documentation. It's because Github has a distinct support for such\ntexts and I want to make use of it. The first folder we're looking into is \\docs. This is where this very text resides.\nRead about Github Pages and Markdown to get a head start.\nSetup the Sources\nYou probably want to start with a \"real\" project and take care about the supporting stuff later. That's fine. So let's first setup what we need\nat least to get things into NPM. For my project it's sort of a library. So I create a folder \\lib:\n\\src\\libBecause a library needs a lot of testing I am lazy writing plain text a demo app is a good choice. That resides in another folder:\n\\src\\demoThe pure package is in \\src\\lib. This is what you get when pulling the package from NPM. Everything else is on Github and the user who wants\nmore must go there. That's why we need the README files. It's all about pointing quickly to the right folders.\nInitialize the Package\nNow once you in the \\lib folder you can start creating your project. Open a command prompt and enter this:\nnpm initIt's an interactive quest:\n\nThere are few things you need to think about before you start:\n\nName of the project (in lower case only -- NPM does not allow upper case characters)\nLicense (such as ISC, MIT, or Apache)\nDescription (this will appear very prominently on NPM)\nKeywords (in case you care about new users)\n\nThis will create a new file package.json. It's more or less the center of your app. It's where all commands you can start come from. \nThe final file in my project looks like this:\n{\n  \"name\": \"svogv\",\n  \"version\": \"0.6.0\",\n  \"description\": \"An advanced library for Angular 6 (Angular in general) for model driven forms and validation support.\",\n  \"main\": \"./bundles/svogv.umd.js\",\n  \"module\": \"./index.js\",\n  \"typings\": \"./index.d.ts\",\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/joergkrause/svogv.git\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [\n    \"angular\",\n    \"angular2\",\n    \"angular4\",\n    \"Reactive\",\n    \"Forms\",\n    \"Validation\",\n    \"Viewmodel\",\n    \"decorators\",\n    \"components\"\n  ],\n  \"license\": \"ICS\",\n  \"bugs\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/joergkrause/svogv/issues\"\n  },\n  \"homepage\": \"https://github.com/joergkrause/svogv#readme\",\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"@angular/http\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^3.1.0\",\n    \"core-js\": \"^2.4.1\",\n    \"rxjs\": \"^5.4.2\",\n    \"systemjs\": \"^0.19.38\",\n    \"zone.js\": \"^0.8.16\"\n  }\n}If you now compare this with yours you find that some parts are missing. Let's dive into package.json first to get what's important. There are few \noptions that simply help others to navigate in your project. These parts are:\n  \"bugs\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/joergkrause/svogv/issues\"\n  },\n  \"homepage\": \"https://github.com/joergkrause/svogv#readme\",\nThey are just pointers to the repository. NPM will extract the values and use this to create links:\n\nFortunatly, if your repository already exists, the paths are right where they shall be. \nAnother part is not yet missing: the dependencies. This part we develop while creating the project. So leave it empty right now. \nThe Project's Core files\nThe project we create is an Angular 2 library, created with TypeScript. So we need to setup this properly. The files we need are:\n\nREADME.md: \n  The documentation's entry point. This file is shown on NPM (not on GitHub). It's sort of your homepage. Remember that we're currently in the \\src\\lib\\ folder and create just the library. The Github's readme will come later.  \n\ntsconfig.json:\n  The configuration for the TypeScript transpiler. That's covered in the chapter about TypeScript.\n\ntypedoc.json:\n  The configuration for the API documentation generator. That's covered in the chapter about API Documentation.\n\nTwo files are just for testing. That's covered in the chapter about unit testing:\n\nsystem-config-spec.ts\ntsconfig-srcs.json\n\n\n\nBefore you can proceed we need to setup a basic build tool chain. The build process is not part of the library nor the demo we write. It's our personal\neffort to assure things go well for our users. That happens in the main (root) folder of the project.\nYou remember the folder structure we started with? \n  \\root\n    \\src\n      \\lib\n      \\demo\n    \\node_modules\n    \\scripts\n    \\test\n    \\tools\nThe part in \\src\\lib is almost done. Now we go to the root folder and setup the build tool chain. We use these tools here:\n\nGulp: An script runner to automate tasks\nTypeScript: The transpiler from TS in JS\nSass: Transpiler for SCSS files into CSS\nTravis: A continuees integration tool to monitor the builds\nKarma: Unit Tests for JavaScript\n\nSetup the Core\nThere are two ways to setup a project. You can use npm and the command line to execute all parts one by one. Or you can create a file named package.json and\nlet the npm tool request all dependencies. Because of the sheer amount of tools we usually need the second way is now way better. So, start by putting this file\nin your root folder:\n{\n  \"name\": \"your-project\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"description\": \"Some good description.\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"gulp build\",\n    \"demoall\": \"gulp build && cd src/demo && npm run exec\",\n    \"execdemo\": \"cd src/demo && npm run exec\",\n    \"test\": \"gulp test\",\n    \"tslint\": \"gulp lint\",\n    \"stylelint\": \"gulp lint\",\n    \"deploy\": \"firebase deploy\",\n    \"docs\": \"gulp docs\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"git+https://github.com/your-git-name/your-project.git\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [\n    \"Angular\",\n    \"Reactive\",\n    \"Forms\",\n    \"Forms\",\n    \"Validation\",\n    \"Viewmodel\",\n    \"decorators\"\n  ],\n  \"author\": \"Your Public Name\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"node\": \">= 5.4.1 Remember changing the descriptive parts:\n\nSave this as package.json into the root. Open a command prompt and excute this command:\nnpm updateYou will have a new folder right now: node_modules. There is no need to touch this folder, ever. npm will do this for you. First check if Gulp is now\npresent by typing \ngulp -vIt should respond like this:\n\n\nIf you see nothing or just an error that gulp is not yet present setup Gulp first.\n\nThe first part of the setup refers to Gulp. Gulp requires a file called gulpfile.js \nto run so called tasks. Because I want use TypeScript my gulpfile is somewhat special:\n'use strict';\n/**\n * Load the TypeScript compiler, then load the TypeScript gulpfile which simply loads all\n * the tasks. The tasks are really inside tools/gulp/tasks.\n */\n\nconst path = require('path');\n\n// Register TS compilation.\nrequire('ts-node').register({\n  project: path.join(__dirname, 'tools/gulp')\n});\n\nrequire('./tools/gulp/gulpfile');The ts-node is a TypeScript execution environment and REPL (Read Execute Print Loop) for node. It's hence sort of an on-the-fly transpiler for TypeScript.\nUsing this we can write the Gulp stuff in TypeScript and Gulp will still execute plain JavaScript.\nBuild tasks\nYou can build and start everything like this:\n\nGo to root of the project\nrun npm run build: build the library \nrun npm run demoall: build libary, demo, and run the demo using local HTTP server on port 3000\nrun npm run execdemo: build and run demo using local HTTP server, but keep library as is\nrun npm run tslint: run the linter for the library\n\n\nYou can run more tasks specific to the demo from there\ncd src/demo and then the particular task \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/about.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/about.html","title":"additional-page - About","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\nSVOGV is an ongoing project that helps Angular developers to create awesome apps quite fast.\n\nAbout me\nI have many years of experience with Web-Frameworks. I’m in the business since the early JavaScript days, know every single bit\nin jQuery and learnt a lot about Knockout, Angular, and Durandal. But time goes on.\nNow Angular is here for a while – the very first time in years – such a strong feeling in our guts that’s now the first step from ancient\ncrap into something really professional. It brings the level we all know from Java and C# and the mature backend frameworks to the front\nend.\nAnd it goes on. TypeScript is here and know we have something that’s an improvement for front end developers that matters:\nTypeScript brings a whole new level to pros like us. And it makes out world easier – at least a bit. And it improves the quality of our\nproduct – not just a bit, a whole new step.\nThe last years brought a lot experience and some nice projects and the outcome is an advanced peace of software that’s going to make our life\nwith Angular a lot easier.\nPurpose\nThis is a project that helps creating sophisticated Angular components. It's not really just for adding to packages and using, but more for\nlearning. There will be a book available that explains the making of completely (planned by June 2019).\nImpress\n  Jörg Krause\n  Hafersteig 113\n  12683 Berlin\n  Germany\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
