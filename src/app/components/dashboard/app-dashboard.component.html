        I have&nbsp;many years of experience with Web-Frameworks.&nbsp;I’m in the business&nbsp;since the early JavaScript days, know every single bit
        in jQuery and learnt a lot about Knockout, Angular, and Durandal. But time goes on.

        <p>
          Now Angular is here for a while – the very first time in years – such a strong feeling in our guts that’s now the first step from ancient
          crap into something really professional. It brings the level we all know from Java and C# and the mature backend frameworks to the front
          end.
        </p>

      <p>
        And it goes on. TypeScript is here and know we have something that’s an improvement for front end developers that matters:

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          TypeScript brings a whole new level to pros like us. And it makes out world easier – at least a bit. And it improves the quality of our
          product – not just a bit, a whole new step.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The last years brought a lot experience and some nice projects and the outcome is an advanced peace of software that’s going to make our life
        with Angular a lot easier.

      <p>
        It’s a <strong>widget library</strong> that bring the power of <strong>Bootstrap 4</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Material 5</strong> to Angular
        and&nbsp;adds some very cool stuff to build sophisticated forms – faster than ever.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          We jump to Version 0.6 to reflect the corresponding Angular Version. As this project is still experimental, the Svgov Version is 0.6 for
          Angular 6, 0.7 for Angular 7 and so on. With Svogv 1, which is in the pipe, we get a new more modular structure and Material support. Stay
          tuned!
