        This is the components (widgets) demo page. The widgets here complement the grid.
        These widgets are not fully blown components
        but instead show the effort to create highly customized stuff. Some parts require
        Bootstrap 4 and hence do not work in other environments properly. However, it's not about
        adding Bootstrap aware Angular stuff, this has been done already by others.
