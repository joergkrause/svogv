It brings the level we all know from Java and C# and the mature backend frameworks to the frontend.\nAnd it goes on. TypeScript is here and know we have something that’s an improvement for front end developers that matters:\nTypeScript brings a whole new level to pros like us. And it makes our world easier – at least a bit. And it improves the quality of our product – not just a bit, a whole new step.\nThe last year (yes, we’re in 2017 already) brought a lot experience and some nice projects and the outcome is an advanced peace of software that’s going to make our life with Angular 4+ a lot easier.\nIt’s a widget library that bring the power of Bootstrap 4 to Angular and adds some very cool stuff to build sophisticated forms – faster than ever.\nWhat is it?\nThe approach was simply the usage of forms as simple as ever in Angular 2+. It's an extension to Angular 2+ that comes as a set of classes and components. \nIt's available as source or as ready to use umd-bundle. The bundle is plane JavaScript. The sources are available via npm and from github. \n\nIt's pretty small, too. It's 107 KB as a bundle and roughly 20KB compressed. In demo I'm down to 207 KB including Angular and Rx!\n\nIssues?\nWe experiencing an issue with the demo on MS Edge browser (crash). IE 11, Chrome and FF are working fine.\nThe SVG stuff (Analog Clock and Loader Icons) both do not work in IE 11. The Loader Icons do not work in Edge either.\nAngular Data Annotations\nHow does it work?\nWe did this by using a straight domain model. Let's assume you have a viewmodel like this:\nexport class UserViewModel {\n\n  @Hidden()\n  id: Number = 0;\n\n  @Display('E-Mail', 'E-Mail address')\n  @Required()\n  @MaxLength(100)\n  @Email()\n  email: string = '';\n\n  @Display('Phone Number', 'The user\\'s phone')\n  @Required()\n  @MaxLength(20)\n  phoneNumber: string = '';\n\n  @Display('User Name', 'The full name')\n  @Required()\n  @MaxLength(100)\n  userName: string = '';\n\n}As you see we use several decorators. We have decorators for display hints, such as Display. And we have decorators to manage the validation, such as MaxLength(). \nThe usage is simple; just import like this:\nimport { \n  Required, \n  MaxLength, \n  Range, \n  Email, \n  Display, \n  Hidden \n} from 'svogv';Or alternatively prefix your import:\nimport * as Validator from 'svogv';\n\nexport class UserViewModel {\n\n  @Validator.Display('E-Mail')\n  eMail: string = '';\n\n}Now the forms part. The form needs to be aware of the decorators. So we have a service that creates an advanced FormGroup instance. We call it the FormValidatorService. \nIn a component this looks like this:\nimport { FormValidatorService } from 'svogv';\n\nexport class EditUserComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  userForm: FormGroup;\n\n  constructor(private fv: FormValidatorService) {\n  }\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    // get validators and error messages from viewmodel type     \n    this.userForm = this.fv.build(UserViewModel);\n  }\n}Now the form knows all about the model. Now let's build a form.\n\n  \n    Edit current user\n      \n      \n      \n      Save\n  \nThe tricky part is the component . This component checks the property type, the decorators, and the form's settings and creates a complete form element in Bootstrap 4 style (the template is, of course, customizable).\nAnd that's it. The form is pretty, has a fully working validation, and is easy to access from your component. And yes, there is no additional code necessary to get it running.\nEven simpler, you can create a complete form with just one tag. Just go like this:\n\n  \n    Edit current user\n     \n    \n      \n         Save\n      \n    \n  \nThe only component here is  that connects to the form using the attribute formGroup. Use binding syntax here as this is an object. The form is buils upon Bootstrap 4 and can be modified by several helper annotations (decorators). \nEspecially those decorators are helpful (just a selection, there are many more):\n\n@Display Determine the label's name and a tooltip (optionally), You can also provide the fields' order.\n@Hidden Exclude as field from a autoform\n@Placeholder A watermark that appears in empty form fields\n@TemplateHint Forces a particular render type. Usually you get fields a shown in the table below. With a hint you can force other types.\n\n\n\n\nData Type\nField Type\nOptions for @TemplateHint\nRemark\n\n\n\n\nstring\ntype=\"text\"\nText, TextArea\nTextArea accepts additional parameters for row and col\n\n\nboolean\ntype=\"checkbox\"\nCheckbox, Toggle, Radio\nDefault is checkbox\n\n\nnumber\ntype=\"number\"\nRange\nDefault is numeric field, Range is a slider\n\n\nDate\ntype=\"date\"\nCalendar\nCalender is provided by browser feature\n\n\nenum\n-Box\n-\nRenders an Enum as Dropdown list\n\n\n\nServer Support through JSON\nAs of version 0.3.5 it's possible to use a specially design JSON object to configure the forms. It's an exact pendant to the decorators. The difference is that you don't need to write any viewmodels in TypeScript. Just deliver an appropriate formatted document from your API and you're set. Here is the definition for the JSON structure:\nexport interface FormValidatorModel {\n  [field: string]: displayType | displayGroupType | formatType | hiddenType | placeHolderType | compareType | maxlengthType | minlengthType | patternType | stringLengthType | emailType | requiredType;\n}The types have the same description as the decorators.\nThe Widgets\nThe widget complement the editor by adding more parts typically used in form apps. There are many such components available, but sometimes there are pieces that we need quite often but nothing is really handy. So I created a small set of such components:\n\nTreeView: An advanced treeview with icon support and many options such as selections and checkboxes. Uses EventEmitter for actions.\nInfoBox: A simple panel with header and some configuration options, best for creating tile based layouts\nDataGrid: A different approach for a grid, it provides a model to handle paging, filtering, and sorting, but no HTML. So the hard part is in the grid and the easy part is up to you. \n\nThis comes with two fun components just made for learning purposes:\n\nAnalogClock: It is what it says -- based on SVG\nLoaderIcon: A circling icon that is highly customizable\n\nWhere to get?\nIt's available from npm by using this command:\nnpm install svogv --saveYou get three parts (at least, this list will grow quickly):\n\nFormValidatorService -- a static class to build reactive forms\nEditor -- the universal editor component\nDecorators -- a set of decorators to manage the behavior of properties\n\nMore to read\nFor more information read the Getting started guide.\nDemo App\nThere is a demo app where you can see the components in action.\nQuick Start\nTo have a running sample in seconds do the following:\n\nClone the repository from Github\nAssure you have node running and npm and Typescript (tsc) is in the path\nExecute this command: npm run setup\nExecute this command: npm run demoall \n\nA browser window shall open automatically and shows a dashboard from where you can navigate the various components. \nSelect these options in the left hand menu:\n\nForms Demo: All about the decorators\nWidgets > Overview: The UI widgets demo\n\n\nThe demo app is independent and has it's own package.json and node_modules folder and hence needs it's own setup. The first command (setup) takes care of this all.\n\nDoes it cost something?\nIt's ISC licensed and it's free. I deeply believe in Open Source and will support the ecosystem by open sourcing all parts of the project. For commerical users such as enterprises we have support options.\nThe SVOGV Widget Library was written by Joerg  Krause, www.joergkrause.de, Berlin / Germany. He has many years of experience with Web-Frameworks. He were in the business in the early JavaScript days, know every single bit in jQuery and learnt a lot about Knockout, Angular, and Durandal. But time goes on. So he moved almost all projects to either AngularJS or Angular 2+. He thinks that knowing one Framework really well is more for our customers than knowing a lot just good. So he decided to do more and start contributing to the Angular ecosystem by creating awesome libraries and components. \nCan I contribute?\nYes, drop me an email with some \"about me\" stuff.

There will be\nbreaking changes between alpha releases; the alpha releases are here for people that want an\nearly look or who like to live on the edge and are very tolerant of breaking API and behavior \nchanges.\n\n0.0.23 (2017-01-20)\nA pre-production release of SVOGV!\nThis is the first we use in production to see how to use basic functions in real world environment.\n\nPlaceholder: A new decorator to put watermarks into editor elements\n\nNew validation decorators:\n\nCompare: Compare two fields, such as in password field combinations\n\nSeveral widgets are now usable:\n\nDataGrid\nEditors\nInfoBox\nMenu, which comes in two flavors:\nDropMenu -- a complex multi level menu\nSideMenu -- a simple one level menu\n\n\nTreeView\nBreadCrumb\nTabs\n\nStill under construction, because of SMIL we use for SVG and that we still need to get rid of:\n\nAnalogClock\nLoaderIcon\n\nThe demo does now use WebPack 2 to create the bundles. SystemJS loader is still working for debugging. \n\n0.2.1 (2017-09-14)\nSVOGV in usable state\nThe base library with the decorators and controls is usable. The HUD part is still very experimental. I'm going to remove this part shortly and create another project out of it. It will make the lib smaller and more reliable.\nThese to elements are now working and good for production:\n\nAnalogClock\nLoaderIcon\n\nThere are many fixes in both, demo and lib.\n\n0.2.3 (2017-09-15)\nA release mostly dedicated to fixes and reorg. Some components sued just to run the demo were actually in the main lib and hence I have removed them and put in the demo. So the code is still there, but nit as part of the main lib. This makes the lib a lot smaller and it clarifies the intention not competing with the other UI libs but put the focus on forms and validation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"contributing.html":{"url":"contributing.html","title":"getting-started - contributing","body":"\n                   \n\nContributing to SVOGV\nWe would love for you to contribute to SVOGV and help make it ever better!\nAs a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:\n\nCode of Conduct\nQuestion or Problem?\nIssues and Bugs\nFeature Requests\nSubmission Guidelines\nCoding Rules\nCommit Message Guidelines\nSigning the CLA\n\nIn case of any questions please contact me at !\n Code of Conduct\nHelp us keep Angular open and inclusive. Please read and follow our Code of Conduct.\n Got a Question or Problem?\nIf you have questions about how to use SVOGV, please direct them to the \nGoogle Group discussion list or StackOverflow. \nPlease note that SVOGV is still in very early development, and the team's capacity \nto answer usage questions is limited. Community chat is also available on Gitter.\n Found an Issue?\nIf you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by\nsubmitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Including an issue \nreproduction (via CodePen, JsBin, Plunkr, etc.) is the absolute best way to help the team quickly\ndiagnose the problem. Screenshots are also helpful.\nYou can help the team even more and submit a Pull Request with a fix.\n Want a Feature?\nYou can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub\nRepository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with\na proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it. SVOGV is in very early \nstages and we are not ready to accept major contributions ahead of the full release.\nPlease consider what kind of change it is:\n\nFor a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be\ndiscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,\nand help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.\nSmall Features can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.\n\n Submitting an Issue\nBefore you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.\nIf your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.\nHelp us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new\nfeatures by not reporting duplicate issues.  Providing the following information will increase the\nchances of your issue being dealt with quickly:\n\nOverview of the Issue - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps\nAngular and Bootstrap Versions - which versions of Angular and Bootstrap are affected\n  (e.g. 2.2.0)\nMotivation for or Use Case - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior\n  is a bug for you\nBrowsers and Operating System - is this a problem with all browsers?\nReproduce the Error - provide a live example (using CodePen, JsBin,\n  Plunker, etc.) or a unambiguous set of steps\nScreenshots - Due to the visual nature of the SVOGV widgets, screenshots can help the team\n  triage issues far more quickly than a text descrption.\nRelated Issues - has a similar issue been reported before?\nSuggest a Fix - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be\n  causing the problem (line of code or commit)\n\nYou can file new issues by providing the above information here.\n Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\nSearch GitHub for an open or closed PR\nthat relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\nPlease sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before sending PRs.\nWe cannot accept code without this.\nMake your changes in a new git branch:\n   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master\nCreate your patch, including appropriate test cases.\n\nFollow our Coding Rules.\nTest your changes with our supported browsers and screen readers.\nRun the full SVOGV test suite, as described in the developer documentation,\nand ensure that all tests pass.\nCommit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our\ncommit message conventions. Adherence to these conventions\nis necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.\n   git commit -aNote: the optional commit -a command line option will automatically \"add\" and \"rm\" edited files.\n\nPush your branch to GitHub:\n  git push my-fork my-fix-branch\nIn GitHub, send a pull request to svogv:master.\n\nIf we suggest changes then:\n\nMake the required updates.\nRe-run the SVOGV test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\nRebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull\nRequest):\ngit rebase master -i\ngit push -f\n\n\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\nAfter your pull request is merged\nAfter your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes\nfrom the main (upstream) repository:\n\nDelete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as\n  follows:\n  git push my-fork --delete my-fix-branch\nCheck out the master branch:\n  git checkout master -f\nDelete the local branch:\n  git branch -D my-fix-branch\nUpdate your master with the latest upstream version:\n  git pull --ff upstream master\n\n Coding Rules\nTo ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:\n\nAll features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).\nAll public API methods must be documented. (Details TBD).\nWe follow Google's JavaScript Style Guide, but wrap all code at\n100 characters.\n\n Commit Message Guidelines\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to more\nreadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.  But also,\nwe use the git commit messages to generate the SVOGV change log.\nCommit Message Format\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer.  The header has a special\nformat that includes a type, a scope and a subject:\n(): \n\n\n\nThe header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.\nAny line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.\nRevert\nIf the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert:, followed by the header of\nthe reverted commit. In the body it should say: This reverts commit ., where the hash is\nthe SHA of the commit being reverted.\nType\nMust be one of the following:\n\nfeat: A new feature\nfix: A bug fix\ndocs: Documentation only changes\nstyle: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing\nsemi-colons, etc)\nrefactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\nperf: A code change that improves performance\ntest: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\nbuild: Changes that affect the build system, CI configuration or external dependencies      (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)\nchore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files\n\nScope\nThe scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example\ndatepicker, dialog, etc.\nSubject\nThe subject contains succinct description of the change:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\"\ndon't capitalize first letter\nno dot (.) at the end\n\nBody\nJust as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\".\nThe body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.\nFooter\nThe footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to\nreference GitHub issues that this commit Closes.\nBreaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines.\nThe rest of the commit message is then used for this.\nA detailed explanation can be found in this document.\n Signing the CLA\nPlease sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before sending pull requests. For any code\nchanges to be accepted, the CLA must be signed. It's a quick process, we promise!\n\nFor individuals we have a simple click-through form.\nFor corporations we'll need you to\nprint, sign and one of scan+email, fax or mail the form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nISC License\nCopyright (c) [year(s)], [copyright holder]\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

That way you can create the form and their behavior on the server.\nThe form's description is an array, where each element describes one field:\n[\n   \"fieldname\": {\n       \"display\": {\n          \"name\": string;\n          \"order\": number;\n          \"description\": string\n       },\n       \"displaygroup\": {\n          \"name\": string;\n          \"order\": number;\n          \"description\": string\n       },\n       \"format\": {\n          \"pipeName\": any;\n          \"pipeParams\": any[]\n       }\n       // ...\n    }\n]The properties are the same as the decorators.
