> SVOGV is an ongoing project that helps Angular developers to create awesome apps quite fast.

### About me

I have&nbsp;many years of experience with Web-Frameworks.&nbsp;I’m in the business&nbsp;since the early JavaScript days, know every single bit
in jQuery and learnt a lot about Knockout, Angular, and Durandal. But time goes on.

Now Angular is here for a while – the very first time in years – such a strong feeling in our guts that’s now the first step from ancient
crap into something really professional. It brings the level we all know from Java and C# and the mature backend frameworks to the front
end.

And it goes on. TypeScript is here and know we have something that’s an improvement for front end developers that matters:

TypeScript brings a whole new level to pros like us. And it makes out world easier – at least a bit. And it improves the quality of our
product – not just a bit, a whole new step.

The last years brought a lot experience and some nice projects and the outcome is an advanced peace of software that’s going to make our life
with Angular a lot easier.

### Purpose

This is a project that helps creating sophisticated Angular components. It's not really just for adding to packages and using, but more for
learning. There will be a book available that explains the making of completely (planned by June 2019).
